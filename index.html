      <h1>EAU DE COLOGNE</h1>
      <p>
         Cologne, by definition, refers to "eau de cologne".
         However, the term 'cologne' is in commom use in the
         English language to denote any fragrance worn by a male.
         It has a  2 - 4 % concentration of Fragrance
         Eau de cologne has much lower concentration to create
         a very light formulation.
         It's primarily used in fragrances designed for males as an
         aftershave or splash-on fragrance.
         it dissipates quickly and last about 2 hours.
      </p>

      <h1>PARFUM OR EXTRAIT</h1>
      <p>
         As parfum contains a high concentration of fragrance, it is
         typically the most expensive.
         it is usually heavier, oilier product than the other type of 
         perfume, and tends to be used more sparingly.
         The smell is long-lasting - an average of 8 hours and up to 24 hours.
         It has 20 - 30 % concentration of fragrance.
      </p>


      <h1>EAU DE PARFUM OR PARFUM DE TOILET</h1>
      <p>
         It has 15 - 20 % Concentration of fragrance.
         Eau de parfum contains a greater concentration of alcohol
         and water and is generally cheaper than parfum.
         it is a lighter product and has a shorter duration of around
         4 to 5 hours.
         Eau de parfum is the most common fragrance type and is the base
         for other fragrance types.
      </p>

      <h1>EAU DE TOILETTE</h1>
      <p>
       Eau de toilette has a low concentration of essential oils and a high
       concentration of alcohol.
       It dissipates quickly and lasts 2 to 3 hours.
       It is a cheaper option and often used for daywear.
       It has 5 - 15 % concentration of fragrance.
      </p>

      <h1>EAU FRAICHE</h1>
      <p>
       Eau Fraiche has the lowest fragrance concentration of all types of parfum,
       and is diluted with water rather than alcohol or oil.
       Common uses for Eau Fraiche include mist, splashes, and veils that are very
       light and dissipate within an hour
      </p>

      <h1>ESPRIT DE PARFUM</h1>
      <p>
         Esprit de parfum is poised between EDP and Extrait, containing almost 30% 
         aromatic compounds, it is most famous from Dior who used the concentration
         in their iconic of the 1980s scent poison: intrestingly poison originally
         came in <b>Eau de Parfum</b> (alongside extrait de parfum of course), before 
         these two being dropped on favour of the more standard <b>Eau de parfum and Eau
         de Toilette in the 1990s</b>
